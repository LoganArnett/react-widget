# React Widget

I recommend using browser-sync for the simple serving of the test index.html file in `test-client`. You can install that using `npm install -g browser-sync`.

### Setup

1. `npm install`
2. To run the react app run `npm run dev`
3. To build and run the app as a widget run `npm start` and you will see the widget is served via `http://localhost:3000/static/index.js` and serve the basic html test-client on port 3001.
